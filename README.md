> ⚠️ **Warning**: This software is still in development (v0.1)

## Overview

MediNet is a software that allows researchers to train their own models in federated environments without programming any line of code. All the configuration is made with an easy-to-use UI.

## Features Available

- ✅ Train your models in federated environments
- ✅ Design models without code with our model designer (currently just sequential models)
- ✅ Your models will always train with Differential Privacy to ensure security and more anonymization
- ✅ Monitor your models during training and see how each client is performing alone, not just the global model

## Future Features

- 🔄 Template models: modify and create models from templates like U-Net, VGG16, etc.
- 🔄 Non-sequential model builder: We are working on creating a new model builder with the capacity to develop non-sequential models
- 🔄 More parameters to configure in your models like learning rate scheduler and other callbacks

## Security Notice

We are currently working on improving the security measures.
